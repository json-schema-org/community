<summary>Find out more about case studies</summary>
If your company would like to share more about what you're doing in public, there's a good chance we'd love to collaborate on a case study.

Please reach out to us via [our Slack](https://json-schema.org/slack) or creating a new Issue in this repo.

From exerience, these case studies can take some time to develop, write, get approved, and published. It's best if you can find out for sure if you can publish a case study with us as early as possible. If you're at a big organization, you'll likely have to get approval from people who have no idea what you're talking about. Here's some context you can share with them.

JSON Schema is an [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/about) Project, under [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). Both the OpenJS Foundation and The Linux Foundation are registered non-profit organizations (501(c)(6)).

By supporting JSON Schema with a case study, you are documenting its success and your smarts in picking it as a solution. JSON Schema case studies help justify the ongoing financial support required to mature, develop, and support the JSON Schema ecosystem. Case studies also demonstrate the strength of the JSON Schema ecosystem in production today. The next case study could be you.
