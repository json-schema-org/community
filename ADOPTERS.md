# Adopters

🚨 **Update - June 2024** 🚨
---
We are so excited to share that we launched the [JSON Schema Landscape](https://landscape.json-schema.org/) as the visual representation of the JSON Schema Ecosystem. With this new and exciting initiative we have a duplicity between this Adopters list and [the Adopters group in Landscape](https://landscape.json-schema.org/?group=adopters), therefore we have decided to manage the adopters list directly in the landscape (See the landscape guide [here](https://landscape.json-schema.org/guide#introduction--adopters)).

**📢 If you're using JSON Schema in your organization, please add your company to the adopters list.**

**🙏 It really helps the project to gain momentum and credibility. It's a small contribution back to the project with a big impact.**

## Why add your company?

- Demonstrates the real-world usage of JSON Schema.
- Provides visibility to organizations that have successfully adopted JSON Schema.
- Encourages other organizations to adopt JSON Schema.
- Builds trust in the JSON Schema ecosystem.

If any organization would like to be added or get removed please make a Pull Request.

## How to add your company

You can add your Company by using the [Adopter form](https://forms.gle/HNZs4vt49GWPPGQq5) or by submitting a PR editting the [landscape.yml](https://github.com/json-schema-org/landscape/blob/main/landscape.yml) file in the [landscape repository](https://github.com/json-schema-org/landscape/). For more information please check the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/json-schema-org/landscape/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-organization-) of the Landscape project.

Looking for extra credit? We also do [case studies](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/8/views/2) and accept sponsorship via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/json-schema).

<summary>Find out more about case studies</summary>
If your company would like to share more about what you're doing in public, there's a good chance we'd love to collaborate on a case study.

Please reach out to us via [our Slack](https://json-schema.org/slack) or creating a new Issue in this repo.

From exerience, these case studies can take some time to develop, write, get approved, and published. It's best if you can find out for sure if you can publish a case study with us as early as possible. If you're at a big organization, you'll likely have to get approval from people who have no idea what you're talking about. Here's some context you can share with them.

By supporting JSON Schema with a case study, you are documenting its success and your smarts in picking it as a solution. JSON Schema case studies help justify the ongoing financial support required to mature, develop, and support the JSON Schema ecosystem. Case studies also demonstrate the strength of the JSON Schema ecosystem in production today. The next case study could be you.
