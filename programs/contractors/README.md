This document covers the organizational and operational aspects of the JSON Schema Contractor Program.

### What is the JSON Schema Contractor Program?

The JSON Schema Contractor Program aims to promote official professional services around JSON Schema coming from TSC members and Ambassors, connecting companies with the key people they need to be successful with JSON Schema, while promoting the sustainability of JSON Schema organization.

### How does the program work?

- The TSC and existing ambassadors can opt-in to be listed as contractors at any time.
- All contractor information will be displayed on the JSON Schema website.

### Contractor requirements

The participation will be determined and checked annually. The only requirement for being listed as a contractor is being a current TSC member or an current Ambassador.

### Become an JSON Schema Contractor

The process of becoming a listed contractor is very simple. Go to the **community** repository and open a PR to edit the `contractors.json` file. The TSC will then evaluate your candidacy!
