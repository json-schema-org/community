This document covers the organizational and operational aspects of the JSON Schema Ambassadors Program.

### What is the JSON Schema Ambassador Program?

The JSON Schema Ambassador Program aims to bring JSON Schema closer to both current users and potential new project users. It also aims to provide users and community members with the necessary tools and resources to:

- Promote collaboration among the JSON Schema ecosystem.
- Engage with the project in some way, either as a contributor, blogger, speaker, etc.
- Speak at community events or write technical content (e.g. blog posts) that solves community needs.
- Nurture community growth and a welcoming environment to spread knowledge about the project.

### How does the program work?

- The ambassador selection process will be as transparent as possible.
- The TSC and existing ambassadors will evaluate applications according to compliance requirements via a traditional PR flow.
- All ambassadors information will be displayed on the JSON Schema website in a list after the PR is merged.

### Ambassador requirements

The participation will be determined and checked annually. The minimum requirement for being an ambassador is to make **4 contributions per year** in the form of articles, talks, videos, podcasts, presentations, driving initiatives, etc.

Ambassadors can be invited to review content (i.e., articles, talks, videos) related to the community. These reviews are optional and will be counted as an additional contribution.

Some clarifications on the type of contributions:
    
- Articles, videos, and podcasts can be published on [json-schema.org/blog](https://json-schema.org/blog) or other domains. 
- Talks and presentations can be displayed at different events or workshops. Within them, JSON Schema should appear at the core of the presentation. The presentation should not be being used as a disguised marketing tool for other products/projects.
- Special contributions should be driven to support the community or enhance its visibility (i.e., getting new sponsors or driving initiatives) 
- If we do not notice or accidentally miscount a contribution, just let us know.
         
Examples: 

1. If contributors publish 3 articles and drive 1 initiative about JSON Schema in eight months, they become ambassadors for the whole year.
2. If contributors make 1 presentation, write 2 articles, and drive 1 initiative, they become ambassadors for the whole year.
3. If you were accepted as ambassador on the 5th of May 2023, you have already fulfilled the requirements. On the 5th of May 2024, we will check if you qualify again after the 5th of May 2023.

### Become an JSON Schema Ambassador

The process of becoming an ambassador is very simple. Go to the **community** repository and open a PR to edit the `ambassadors.json` file. The TSC will then evaluate your candidacy!

That PR doesn't have to be created by the ambassador candidate; any community member may open a PR to submit someone's application to the JSON Schema Ambassador Program. 

Get on board and become an ambassador!
