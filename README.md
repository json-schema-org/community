# JSON Schema Community

Welcome to the JSON Schema community! You've arrived at the perfect place to begin your journey as a contributor. Whether it's assisting with documentation, writing a blog post, enhancing the website, delivering presentations, or any other form of contribution, there's plenty of opportunities to get involved in the project. We are a friendly, collaborative group and look forward to working together.

## Introduction
This repo is a place to discuss and debate various aspects of running the JSON Schema organisation, how we work as a community, and our expectations.

### Discussions and Slack

Reach out with any questions you may have and we'll make sure to answer them as soon as possible and as a community member feel free to jump in and answer questions. 

JSON Schema utilizes Slack and GitHub Discussions to facilitate our communications, each serving unique purposes to support our community effectively.

Slack is the go-to for lively conversations, channel announcements, one-on-one support, and immediate assistance, making real-time communication seamless and efficient. However, Slack isn't ideal for housing detailed discussions, long-term planning, or tracking the evolution of ideas and decisions.

For more in-depth discussions, planning, and documenting significant decisions, we use GitHub Discussions. It allows us to work together on significant decisions more effectively and provides long standing point of reference for our discussions.

| 💬 Discussions       | https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/discussions

### Community meetings
