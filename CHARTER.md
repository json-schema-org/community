# JSON Schema Charter
<!-- This document is managed in the json-schema-org/community GitHub repository. Please do NOT modify this file in another repository as changes may be overridden. -->

## 0: Guiding Principles
The JSON Schema project strives to be open and transparent as much as is possible, and wish to enable anyone to interact and engage with any area of our work.

Having no structure in place usually leads to one that is informal and undocumented, making it difficult to meet our own expectations of how the TSC wish to operate. As such, the JSON Schema project defines the following charter which includes aspects of the governance model to which the TSC subscribe and by which the TSC operate.

## 1: Scope
JSON Schema aims to enable the confident and reliable use of the JSON data format. It does this primarily by providing specification documents which define a declarative language that allows annotation and validation of JSON documents.
While JSON Schema's primary target is constraint-based data validation, it continues to be used across the whole stack, in different stages of a given project, and for purposes beyond its original design. The JSON Schema project aims to enable these additional and emergent use cases.

### 1.1: In-scope
The scope of the JSON Schema project is split into two sections: primary and secondary concerns.
Primary concerns are areas the JSON Schema project wish to give focus to. Secondary concerns, while remaining in scope, aren't areas of focus, and would require dedicated championing by community members to come to fruition.

Primary Concerns
- Publication of the JSON Schema standard
  - Validation of JSON-compatible data
  - Semantic annotation of JSON-compatible data
  - Interoperability
  - Extensibility
- Critical tooling
- Documentation
- Test suite
- Community
  - Enabling schema authors
  - Enabling implementers
  - Engaging with industry
  - Engaging with upstream and downstream standards and projects
  - Communicating value
  - Ensuring the sustainability of the project

Secondary Concerns
- Hypermedia
- Generating JSON Schema
- Using JSON Schema to generate
  - Code (including types or classes)
  - UI (including forms)
  - Databases
- Relational validation
- Vocabularies registry

### 1.2: Out-of-Scope
Neither standards that the JSON Schema project uses (such as JSON and IRI) nor standards or projects that use JSON Schema (such as OpenAPI or AsyncAPI) are in scope, nor does the JSON Schema project have any control over them.

## 2: Lieu of a Board

In lieu of a separate Business Governance Board, the TSC assumes all authority in decision making.

## 3: JSON Schema Governing Body (TSC)
The JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is initially established from the observed major contributors who are currently active and in good standing.

The TSC must have a minimum of four members. There is no maximum TSC membership size.

TSC memberships are not time-limited.

The TSC follows the decision-making process defined in this charter unless otherwise documented.

The TSC aims to work asynchronously. TSC meetings are pre-announced, public, and recorded. Minutes are taken and the recordings made available. If there is a reasonable reason (such as security or privacy), any portion of a meeting, its minutes, and recording, may be kept private.

## 4: Roles & Responsibilities

The JSON Schema project is governed by a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

The TSC has final authority over this project including:

- Technical direction
- Project governance and process (including this policy, though changes to this policy must be approved by the CPC)
- Contribution policy
- GitHub repository hosting and administration
- Establishment of and delegation to working groups or teams
- Mediating technical conflicts

It is also responsible for establishing a Code of Conduct Committee suitable for mediating non-technical conflicts.
In any period where such a committee is not yet formed, the TSC must assume temporary responsibility of mediating such conflicts in addition to responsibilities enumerated above.

In joining the TSC, members commit to communicate on a regular basis and respond to issues raised by the TSC in a timely manner. If they are no longer able or willing to make such a commitment, they should discuss this with the TSC or a TSC Chair.


## 4.1 Decision-making

The TSC follows a consensus-seeking decision making model in which joint decisions are agreed upon by all members whenever possible.
In some situations, a vote may be preferable, however a formal vote is expected to be an infrequent occurrence invoked only when consensus cannot be reached after multiple attempts to reach TSC consensus.
TSC discussions and decisions are to be assumed public by default, unless otherwise decided upon on a case-by-case basis by the TSC.
Precise criteria for which decisions are to be left private are left to the TSC's discretion and assumed to include security-related reports or discussions with a third-party who wishes their interactions to remain private, such as when they concern yet unpublished case studies or partnerships which are not yet ready for announcement.

The TSC is expected to agree upon and maintain specific process and procedure which facilitate labelling or communicating which decisions have been formally decided upon by the TSC.
This process should include a mechanism for identifying ongoing TSC discussions and decision-making.
When concluded, decisions should include reasoning and/or justification of the TSC, as well as indication of the consensus of the committee, or lack thereof in the case of a voted decision as indicated above.
Private decisions should also be documented in a private location accessible to parties expected to have access to them. In the spirit of transparency, the TSC will strive to make anonymized or redacted versions of these decisions publicly available.

## Code of Conduct Findings & Violations

Code of Conduct incidents must be reported to the TSC by the Code of Conduct committee.
Reports must remain anonymous, as per the Code of Conduct, but should be documented in a manner similar to private TSC decisions as mentioned.
